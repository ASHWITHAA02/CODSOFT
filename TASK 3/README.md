 Iris Flower Classification 

Project Overview:

This project aims to classify Iris flowers into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica using machine learning. The dataset used contains four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. This is a classic beginner-level classification problem that introduces essential concepts of supervised learning.

 Tools & Libraries Used:

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for ML models)
-  VS Code

Steps Followed:

1. Importing Libraries  
2. Loading and Understanding the Dataset  
3. Data Visualization and Exploration (EDA)  
4. Preprocessing (Label Encoding, Train-Test Split)  
5. Model Training (Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM)  
6. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)  
7. Final Prediction

 Output:

The model classifies input flower measurements into one of the three species. The accuracy and performance metrics are included in the notebook. 
Visualizations such as pairplots and correlation heatmaps help understand feature relationships.
