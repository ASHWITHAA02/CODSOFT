# Movie Rating Prediction 

This project predicts the IMDb rating of a movie based on features such as genre, director, and lead actors. It uses regression techniques on historical movie data from Kaggle to understand the factors that influence movie ratings.

# Objective
To build a machine learning model that can estimate a movie’s rating using important features like:
- Genres
- Director Name
- Actor Names

# libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression)

# Project Workflow
1. Data Loading & Cleaning
2. Feature Selection
3. Categorical Encoding
4. Model Training (Linear Regression)
5. Prediction & Evaluation (MSE, R² Score)
6. Visualization of Results

# Results
The model gives a basic estimation of IMDb scores with acceptable accuracy using linear regression. It helps identify how key features impact movie ratings.
