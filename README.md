##Conclusion:
            Through these four data science projects, I explored key concepts in data analysis, machine learning, and real-world problem solving using Python. Each project helped me strengthen my understanding of data preprocessing, model selection, evaluation, and visualization techniques. This internship experience with CODSOFT allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical datasets, preparing me for more advanced work in data science and machine learning.
