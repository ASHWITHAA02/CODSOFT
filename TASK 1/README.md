1. Titanic Survival Prediction

This project predicts the survival of Titanic passengers using machine learning. 
It uses the Titanic dataset from Kaggle and applies classification algorithms to make predictions.

2. Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

 3. Steps Followed

1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training (Logistic Regression)
5. Evaluation & Prediction

4. Output

The model predicts `Survived (1)` or `Not Survived (0)` based on features like age, gender, class, etc.
