# ðŸ“ˆ Sales Prediction using Machine Learning in Python

This project demonstrates how to forecast sales using advertising data by leveraging machine learning techniques. It simulates real-world advertising spend (TV, social media, radio) and predicts product sales using regression models.

# Project Description:

Predicting sales is critical for effective marketing and inventory decisions. This project walks through:

- Synthetic data generation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature scaling
- Linear Regression model training
- Model evaluation
- Visualization of predictions

# Technologies Used:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
